##WHODUNIT##
Welcome to Tudor Mansion. Your host, Mr. John Boddy, has met an untimely end—he’s the victim of foul play. To win this game, you must determine whodunit.
Unfortunately for you (though even more unfortunately for Mr. Boddy), the only evidence you have is a 24-bit BMP file called clue.bmp,  that Mr. Boddy whipped up on his computer in his final moments. Hidden among this file’s red "noise" is a drawing of whodunit.

##RESIZE##
Implement now in resize.c a program called resize that resizes 24-bit uncompressed BMPs by a factor of n. Your program should accept exactly three command-line arguments, per the below usage, whereby the first (n) must be a positive integer less than or equal to 100, the second the name of the file to be resized, and the third the name of the resized version to be written.
<pre><code>./resize n infile outfile</code></pre>

##RECOVER##
I spent the past several days snapping photos of people I know, all of which were saved by my digital camera as JPEGs on a 1GB CompactFlash (CF) card. Unfortunately, I’m not very good with computers, and I somehow deleted them all! Thankfully, in the computer world, "deleted" tends not to mean "deleted" so much as "forgotten." My computer insists that the CF card is now blank, but I’m pretty sure it’s lying to me. Write a program that recovers these photos.
