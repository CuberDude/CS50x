##Caesar Cipher##
r Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. Write a program to implement Caesar Cipher in C.

##Vigenère’s cipher##
The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a 'Keyword'. It is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. Write a program to implement Vigenère’s Cipher in C.

##Initializing##
Write, in a program that prompts a user for their name (using GetString to obtain their name as a string) and then outputs their initials in uppercase with no spaces or periods, followed by a newline (\n).
